# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MDSuite code! Currently,
MDSuite is in the process of an API change that will greatly simplify external
contributions as well as the code structure. These updates will coincide with
the first full version release of the MDSuite software.

For this reason, we are currently not looking for external contributions. Check
back in with us soon for updated details about how you can contribute.
