Welcome to MDSuite's documentation!
===================================

This package was conceived out of the idea that scientists can
perform computational experiments without filling their computers
with mislabelled and arbitrary directories. Here you will find the
documentation for the mdsuite python package, as well as significant
amount of theoretical background on the different types of analysis being
performed. If you have any questions feel free to get into contact with
us whether it is about how to use to code, some questions about theory, or
about what you might like to see in future releases, we are always happy to
hear from our users.
