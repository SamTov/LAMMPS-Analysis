Here you will find all the information you need to start using the MDSuite code for various different types of
analysis. We have written this into a separate section to facilitate immediate usage. If you want more information
about the code please see the :doc:`modules and classes <modules_and_classes>` documentation.

**Our current top priority is updating these use examples as soon as possible. Expect
updates in the coming days. In the mean time, check out the scripts in the examples
directory or in the tests.**
