Quickstart Guide
================
Here we outline briefly how to get started with MDSuite, namely importing the package and creating an Experiment.

Installation
------------

With pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd MDSuite
    $ pip3 install .

Usage
-----

As MDSuite is installed simply as a python package, once installed, it can be called from any 
python program you are writing. This is done in the usual way, 

.. code-block:: python
        
        import mdsuite
        # or
        import mdsuite as mds
        from mdsuite import <module>

which will load whichever modules are desired. Once you have import the module, you will need 
to begin your first analysis.
