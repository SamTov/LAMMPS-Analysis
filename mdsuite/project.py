Module for the Project class

Summary

Module containing all the code for the Project class. The project class is the governing class in the
mdsuite program. Within the project class include all of the method required to add a new experiment and

class Project:

    Class for the main container of all experiments.

    The Project class acts as the encompassing class for analysis with MDSuite. It contains all method required to add
    and analyze new experiments. These experiments may then be compared with one another quickly. The state of the class
    is saved and updated after each operation in order to retain the most current state of the analysis.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
            The name of the project

    description : str
            A short description of the project

    storage_path : str
            Where to store the tensor_values and databases. This may not simply be the current directory if the
            databases are expected to be quite large.

    experiments : dict
            A dict of class objects. Class objects are instances of the experiment class for different
            experiments.

        Project class constructor
